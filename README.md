## Introduction

Cricket is a sport rich in variety, with numerous types of shots that players can perform. This project aims to automatically classify different cricket shots using video data. The model is built using a combination of Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) networks and pose estimation, enabling the extraction of both spatial and temporal features from the video frames.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture includes:
- **ConvLSTM2D layers**: For capturing spatiotemporal dependencies.
- **Pose Estimation**: Used alongside frame features to enhance classification accuracy.
- **Dense Layers**: To finalize the prediction based on combined features.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros
- **Spatiotemporal Feature Extraction**: The use of ConvLSTM enables effective capture of both spatial and temporal features in video sequences.
- **Pose Integration**: Enhances the modelâ€™s ability to classify shots by using pose information.
- **Generalizable**: The architecture can be adapted for other sports or activities involving complex motions.

### Cons
- **Computationally Intensive**: Training requires significant computational resources, especially for larger datasets.
- **Overfitting**: The model shows a potential to overfit, as evidenced by the divergence between training and validation accuracy/loss.

## Possible Future Work
- **Data Augmentation**: Implementing data augmentation techniques to reduce overfitting.
- **Transfer Learning**: Exploring pre-trained models to reduce training time and improve accuracy.
- **Real-Time Inference**: Optimizing the model for real-time inference on low-power devices.
